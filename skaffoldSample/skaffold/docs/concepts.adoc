== Concepts
This document explains the concepts you will encounter when using Skaffold.

=== Skaffold configuration file or `skaffold.yaml`
The Skaffold configuration file is where the workflow is configured.
In this file you define the tools you will be using and their configuration.

=== Phases
There are 3 main phases in the Skaffold workflow definition.

==== 1. Build
In the build phase, Skaffold will use the tool of your choice to build an artifact.
Artifacts are Docker images
that you would like to deploy into your Kubernetes cluster when changes are made to them.

==== 2. Push
In the push phase, Skaffold ensures that your image is uploaded to the registry referenced in the image name.
Before
running Skaffold you should ensure that you are able to push to your configured image registry.

When using local Kubernetes clusters like Minikube or Docker for Desktop, the push is skipped
because the image is already available locally.

==== 3. Deploy
The deploy step ensures that the most recent artifacts are running in the cluster.
You can use different
tools for deployment, for example `kubectl` or `helm`.
Each deployment type has parameters that allow you to
define how you want your app to be installed and updated.

=== Artifact
Artifacts are the outputs of the build phase.
Artifacts are created by running a set of steps on some
source code.
Currently the only artifact type is a Docker image.
You can define multiple artifacts that Skaffold
needs to build.
When running in `dev` mode, Skaffold will only rebuild artifacts whose source code has changed.
Artifacts are configured by pointing Skaffold at a Dockerfile to build and giving the image a name.

=== Tag Policy
Tag policies are configured in the build phase and tell Skaffold how your images should be tagged when they are pushed.

During development, it is best to have Skaffold use content based tagging strategy, `sha256`, so that changes to your source
code cause Kubernetes to redeploy your new images.

When running Skaffold as part of a CI/CD pipeline you can use the `gitCommit` strategy so that your deployed resources
reference the source code commit that they were deployed from.
